    """Evaluate a convergent integral numerically using tanh-sinh quadrature.

    In practice, tanh-sinh quadrature achieves quadratic convergence for

    with the number of function evaluations [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        The function to be integrated. The signature must be::
<<<<<<< HEAD

            f(xi: ndarray, *argsi) -> ndarray

        where each element of ``xi`` is a finite real number and ``argsi`` is a tuple,
        which may contain an arbitrary number of arrays that are broadcastable
        with ``xi``. `f` must be an elementwise function: see documentation of parameter
        `preserve_shape` for details. It must not mutate the array ``xi`` or the arrays
        in ``argsi``.
        If ``f`` returns a value with complex dtype when evaluated at
        either endpoint, subsequent arguments ``x`` will have complex dtype
        (but zero imaginary part).
    a, b : float array_like
        Real lower and upper limits of integration. Must be broadcastable with one
        another and with arrays in `args`. Elements may be infinite.
    args : tuple of array_like, optional
        Additional positional array arguments to be passed to `f`. Arrays
        must be broadcastable with one another and the arrays of `a` and `b`.
        If the callable for which the root is desired requires arguments that are
        not broadcastable with `x`, wrap that callable with `f` such that `f`
        accepts only `x` and broadcastable ``*args``.
=======
            func(x: ndarray, *fargs) -> ndarray
         where each element of ``x`` is a finite real and ``fargs`` is a tuple,
         which may contain an arbitrary number of arrays that are broadcastable
         with `x`. ``func`` must be an elementwise-scalar function; see
         documentation of parameter `preserve_shape` for details.
         If ``func`` returns a value with complex dtype when evaluated at
         either endpoint, subsequent arguments ``x`` will have complex dtype
         (but zero imaginary part).
    a, b : array_like
        Real lower and upper limits of integration. Must be broadcastable.
        Elements may be infinite.
    args : tuple, optional
        Additional positional arguments to be passed to `func`. Must be arrays
        broadcastable with `a` and `b`. If the callable to be integrated
        requires arguments that are not broadcastable with `a` and `b`, wrap
        that callable with `f`. See Examples.
>>>>>>> 145c46dcb5b19a9082f2e39ee66b3b5564513083
    log : bool, default: False
        Setting to True indicates that `f` returns the log of the integrand
        and that `atol` and `rtol` are expressed as the logs of the absolute
        and relative errors. In this case, the result object will contain the
        log of the integral and error. This is useful for integrands for which
        numerical underflow or overflow would lead to inaccuracies.
        When ``log=True``, the integrand (the exponential of `f`) must be real,
        but it may be negative, in which case the log of the integrand is a
        complex number with an imaginary part that is an odd multiple of π.
    maxlevel : int, default: 10
        The maximum refinement level of the algorithm.

        At the zeroth level, `f` is called once, performing 16 function
        evaluations. At each subsequent level, `f` is called once more,
        approximately doubling the number of function evaluations that have
        been performed. Accordingly, for many integrands, each successive level
        will double the number of accurate digits in the result (up to the
        limits of floating point precision).

        The algorithm will terminate after completing level `maxlevel` or after
        another termination condition is satisfied, whichever comes first.
    minlevel : int, default: 2
        The level at which to begin iteration (default: 2). This does not
        change the total number of function evaluations or the abscissae at
        which the function is evaluated; it changes only the *number of times*
        `f` is called. If ``minlevel=k``, then the integrand is evaluated at
        all abscissae from levels ``0`` through ``k`` in a single call.
        Note that if `minlevel` exceeds `maxlevel`, the provided `minlevel` is
        ignored, and `minlevel` is set equal to `maxlevel`.
    atol, rtol : float, optional
        Absolute termination tolerance (default: 0) and relative termination
        tolerance (default: ``eps**0.75``, where ``eps`` is the precision of
<<<<<<< HEAD
        the result dtype), respectively.  Iteration will stop when
        ``res.error < atol + rtol * abs(res.df)``. The error estimate is as

        described in [1]_ Section 5. While not theoretically rigorous or
        conservative, it is said to work well in practice. Must be non-negative
        and finite if `log` is False, and must be expressed as the log of a
        non-negative and finite number if `log` is True.
    preserve_shape : bool, default: False
<<<<<<< HEAD
        In the following, "arguments of `f`" refers to the array ``xi`` and
        any arrays within ``argsi``. Let ``shape`` be the broadcasted shape
        of `a`, `b`, and all elements of `args` (which is conceptually
        distinct from ``xi` and ``argsi`` passed into `f`).

        - When ``preserve_shape=False`` (default), `f` must accept arguments
          of *any* broadcastable shapes.

        - When ``preserve_shape=True``, `f` must accept arguments of shape
          ``shape`` *or* ``shape + (n,)``, where ``(n,)`` is the number of
          abscissae at which the function is being evaluated.

<<<<<<< HEAD
        In either case, for each scalar element ``xi[j]`` within ``xi``, the array
        returned by `f` must include the scalar ``f(xi[j])`` at the same index.
        Consequently, the shape of the output is always the shape of the input
        ``xi``.

    The limits of integration and elements of `args` may be broadcastable
    arrays, and integration is performed elementwise.

    >>> dist = stats.gausshyper(13.8, 3.12, 2.51, 5.18)

    By default, `preserve_shape` is False, and therefore the callable
    `f` may be called with arrays of any broadcastable shapes.
    For example:

    >>> shapes = []
    >>> def f(x, c):
    ...    shape = np.broadcast_shapes(x.shape, c.shape)
    ...    shapes.append(shape)

    understand how `tanhsinh` computes accurate results - note that
=======
    >>> res = _tanhsinh(f, 0, 1, args=(c,), minlevel=1)

>>>>>>> 145c46dcb5b19a9082f2e39ee66b3b5564513083
    higher values of ``c`` correspond with higher frequency sinusoids.
    The higher frequency sinusoids make the integrand more complicated,
    so more function evaluations are required to achieve the target
    accuracy:

    >>> res.nfev

    The initial ``shape``, ``(4,)``, corresponds with evaluating the
    integrand at a single abscissa and all four frequencies; this is used
    for input validation and to determine the size and dtype of the arrays
    that store results. The next shape corresponds with evaluating the
    integrand at an initial grid of abscissae and all four frequencies.
    Successive calls to the function double the total number of abscissae at
    which the function has been evaluated. However, in later function
    evaluations, the integrand is evaluated at fewer frequencies because
    the corresponding integral has already converged to the required
    tolerance. This saves function evaluations to improve performance, but
    it requires the function to accept arguments of any shape.

    "Vector-valued" integrands, such as those written for use with
    `scipy.integrate.quad_vec`, are unlikely to satisfy this requirement.
    For example, consider

    >>> def f(x):
    ...    return [x, np.sin(10*x), np.cos(30*x), x*np.sin(100*x)**2]

    function *could* be converted to a compatible form with the introduction of

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        The function that evaluates terms to be summed. The signature must be::

            f(x: ndarray, *args) -> ndarray

<<<<<<< HEAD
        where each element of ``x`` is a finite real and ``args`` is a tuple,
        which may contain an arbitrary number of arrays that are broadcastable
        with ``x``.

        `f` must be an elementwise function: each element ``f(x)[i]``
        must equal ``f(x[i])`` for all indices ``i``. It must not mutate the
        array ``x`` or the arrays in ``args``, and it must return NaN where
        the argument is NaN.

        `f` must represent a smooth, positive, unimodal function of `x` defined at
        *all reals* between `a` and `b`.
    a, b : float array_like
        Real lower and upper limits of summed terms. Must be broadcastable.
        Each element of `a` must be less than the corresponding element in `b`.
    step : float array_like
        Finite, positive, real step between summed terms. Must be broadcastable
        with `a` and `b`. Note that the number of terms included in the sum will
        be ``floor((b - a) / step)`` + 1; adjust `b` accordingly to ensure
        that ``f(b)`` is included if intended.
    args : tuple of array_like, optional
        Additional positional arguments to be passed to `f`. Must be arrays
        broadcastable with `a`, `b`, and `step`. If the callable to be summed
        requires arguments that are not broadcastable with `a`, `b`, and `step`,
        wrap that callable with `f` such that `f` accepts only `x` and
        broadcastable ``*args``. See Examples.
=======
         where each element of ``x`` is a finite real and ``args`` is a tuple,
         which may contain an arbitrary number of arrays that are broadcastable
         with `x`. `f` must represent a smooth, positive, and monotone decreasing
         function of `x`; `_nsum` performs no checks to verify that these conditions
         are met and may return erroneous results if they are violated.
    a, b : array_like
        Real lower and upper limits of summed terms. Must be broadcastable.
        Each element of `a` must be finite and less than the corresponding
        element in `b`, but elements of `b` may be infinite.
    step : array_like
        Finite, positive, real step between summed terms. Must be broadcastable
        with `a` and `b`.
    args : tuple, optional
        Additional positional arguments to be passed to `f`. Must be arrays
        broadcastable with `a`, `b`, and `step`. If the callable to be summed
        requires arguments that are not broadcastable with `a`, `b`, and `step`,
        wrap that callable with `f`. See Examples.
>>>>>>> 145c46dcb5b19a9082f2e39ee66b3b5564513083
    log : bool, default: False
        Setting to True indicates that `f` returns the log of the terms
        and that `atol` and `rtol` are expressed as the logs of the absolute
        and relative errors. In this case, the result object will contain the
        log of the sum and error. This is useful for summands for which
        numerical underflow or overflow would lead to inaccuracies.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    maxterms : int, default: 2**20
        The maximum number of terms to evaluate for direct summation.
        Additional function evaluations may be performed for input
        validation and integral evaluation.
=======
    maxterms : int, default: 2**32
        The maximum number of terms to evaluate when summing directly. 
        Additional function evaluations may be performed for input
        validation and integral evaluation. 
>>>>>>> 145c46dcb5b19a9082f2e39ee66b3b5564513083
    atol, rtol : float, optional
        Absolute termination tolerance (default: 0) and relative termination
        tolerance (default: ``eps**0.5``, where ``eps`` is the precision of
        the result dtype), respectively. Must be non-negative
        and finite if `log` is False, and must be expressed as the log of a
        non-negative and finite number if `log` is True.

        arrays of the same shape.)

        success : bool
            ``True`` when the algorithm terminated successfully (status ``0``);
            ``False`` otherwise.

            - ``0`` : The algorithm converged to the specified tolerances.
            - ``-1`` : Element(s) of `a`, `b`, or `step` are invalid
            - ``-2`` : Numerical integration reached its iteration limit;

              the tolerances, so the error estimate exceeds the tolerances.
              Consider increasing `maxterms` or loosening `tolerances`.
              Alternatively, the callable may not be unimodal, or the limits of
              summation may be too far from the function maximum. Consider
              increasing `maxterms` or breaking the sum into pieces.

        sum : float array
            An estimate of the sum.
        error : float array
            An estimate of the absolute error, assuming all terms are non-negative,

    Notes
    -----
    The method implemented for infinite summation is related to the integral
    test for convergence of an infinite series: assuming `step` size 1 for
    simplicity of exposition, the sum of a monotone decreasing function is bounded by

    .. math::

        \int_u^\infty f(x) dx \leq \sum_{k=u}^\infty f(k) \leq \int_u^\infty f(x) dx + f(u)

    Let :math:`a` represent  `a`, :math:`n` represent `maxterms`, :math:`\epsilon_a`
    represent `atol`, and :math:`\epsilon_r` represent `rtol`.
    The implementation first evaluates the integral :math:`S_l=\int_a^\infty f(x) dx`
    as a lower bound of the infinite sum. Then, it seeks a value :math:`c > a` such
    that :math:`f(c) < \epsilon_a + S_l \epsilon_r`, if it exists; otherwise,
    let :math:`c = a + n`. Then the infinite sum is approximated as
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
    
>>>>>>> 145c46dcb5b19a9082f2e39ee66b3b5564513083
    .. math::

        \sum_{k=a}^{c-1} f(k) + \int_c^\infty f(x) dx + f(c)/2

    and the reported error is :math:`f(c)/2` plus the error estimate of
<<<<<<< HEAD
    numerical integration. Note that the integral approximations may require
    evaluation of the function at points besides those that appear in the sum,
    so `f` must be a continuous and monotonically decreasing function defined
    for all reals within the integration interval. However, due to the nature
    of the integral approximation, the shape of the function between points
    that appear in the sum has little effect. If there is not a natural
    extension of the function to all reals, consider using linear interpolation,
    which is easy to evaluate and preserves monotonicity.

    The approach described above is generalized for non-unit
    `step` and finite `b` that is too large for direct evaluation of the sum,
    i.e. ``b - a + 1 > maxterms``. It is further generalized to unimodal
    functions by directly summing terms surrounding the maximum.
    This strategy may fail:

    - If the left limit is finite and the maximum is far from it.
    - If the right limit is finite and the maximum is far from it.
    - If both limits are finite and the maximum is far from the origin.

    In these cases, accuracy may be poor, and `nsum` may return status code ``4``.

    Although the callable `f` must be non-negative and unimodal,
    `nsum` can be used to evaluate more general forms of series. For instance, to
    evaluate an alternating series, pass a callable that returns the difference
    between pairs of adjacent terms, and adjust `step` accordingly. See Examples.
